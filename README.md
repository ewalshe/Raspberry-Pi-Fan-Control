## The Setup

This setup uses GPIO pin 18 with an NPN Transistor (S8050). Wiring diagrams 
for this setup are provided in the `wiring_diagrams` directory, with an image 
of the most basic setup below.

## Running on Boot

Here's how to run this script automatically on boot:
- Modify the shell script to ensure you have the correct path _run-fan.py_.
- Make the files executable using _sudo chmod a+x run-fan.py_ and _sudo chmod a+x launcher.sh_.
- Use crontab (or another method) to execute _launcher.sh_ on boot.

The code included in this repository is mainly the work of others, with some modification 
and adaptations made to the code to document the approach.
